/*
Inorder Tree Traversal without recursion and without stack!
        Using Morris Traversal, we can traverse the tree without using stack and recursion. The idea of
        Morris Traversal is based on Threaded Binary Tree. In this traversal, we first create links to
        Inorder successor and print the data using these links, and finally revert the changes to restore
        original tree.

        1. Initialize current as root
        2. While current is not NULL
        If the current does not have left child
            a) Print currentâ€™s data
            b) Go to the right, i.e., current = current->right
        Else
            a) Make current as the right child of the rightmost node in current's left subtree
            b) Go to this left child, i.e., current = current->left

        Although the tree is modified through the traversal, it is reverted back to its original shape
        after the completion. Unlike Stack based traversal, no extra space is required for this traversal.
