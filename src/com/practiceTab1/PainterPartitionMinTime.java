/**
The painterâ€™s partition problem | Set 2
We have to paint n boards of length {A1, A2, .. An}. There are k painters available and
 each takes 1 unit time to paint 1 unit of board.
 The problem is to find the minimum time to get this job done under the constraints that any
 painter will only paint continuous sections of boards, say board {2, 3, 4} or only board
 {1} or nothing but not board {2, 4, 5}.

Examples :
Input : k = 2, A = {10, 10, 10, 10}
Output : 20.
Here we can divide the boards into 2equal sized partitions, so each painter gets 20 units
 of board and the total time taken is 20.

Input : k = 2, A = {10, 20, 30, 40}
Output : 60.
Here we can divide first 3 boards for one painter and the last board for second painter.

 In this post we will look into a more efficient approach using binary search. We know that
 the invariant of binary search has two main parts:
 * the target value would always be in the searching range.
 * the searching range will decrease in each loop so that the termination can be reached.

 We also know that the values in this range must be in sorted order. Here our target value
 is the maximum sum of a contiguous section in the optimal allocation of boards.

 Now how can we apply binary search for this? We can fix the possible low to high range for the
 target value and narrow down our search to get the optimal allocation.

 We can see that the highest possible value in this range is the sum of all the elements
 in the array and this happens when we allot 1 painter all the sections of the board.
 The lowest possible value of this range is the maximum value of the array max, as in this
 allocation we can allot max to one painter and divide the other sections such

 that the cost of them is less than or equal to max and as close as possible to max.
 Now if we consider we use x painters in the above scenarios, it is obvious that as the value
 in the range increases, the value of x decreases and vice-versa. From this we can find the
 target value when x=k and use a helper function to find x,
 the minimum number of painters required when the maximum length of section a painter can
 paint is given.
