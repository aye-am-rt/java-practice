package com.Arrays.SubsetSums;
/*Given an array, Print sum of all subsets
        Objective: Given an array of numbers, write an algorithm to print all the subsets sum
        individually.
        Example:
        Given Input: [1, 2]
        Output: 3 1 2 0
        Explanation: subsets are [0], [1], [2], [1, 2]

        subsets are == [0], [1], [2], [1, 2]    subsets and subArrays are different
        sub-arrays ==  [1]  [1 ,2]   [2]
        */

//Approach: Recursion  Time Complexity: O(2^N)

//Every element of the array has two choices, whether to include that element in the subset or
//exclude that element from the subset. So initialize sum = 0, now for each element in the
//array â€“ add it to sum and make a recursive call, do not add it to sum and make a recursive
//call. Print the sum at the base case when the current element is the last element of an array.
