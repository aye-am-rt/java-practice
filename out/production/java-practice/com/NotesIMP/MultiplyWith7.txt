Efficient way to multiply with 7
We can multiply a number by 7 using bitwise operator. First left shift the number by 3 bits
(you will get 8n) then subtract the original number from the shifted number and return the
difference (8n â€“ n).

// a similar way can be applied tu multiply with 15 ...just left shift 4 bits which will be equal
// to (2^4) ==> 16n and then just subtract n which will give you 15n . answer.!!!!!!!!!!

class GFG {

    static int multiplyBySeven(int n)
    {
        /* Note the inner bracket here.
        This is needed because precedence
        of '-' operator is higher
        than '<<' */
        return ((n << 3) - n);
    }

    // Driver code
    public static void main (String arg[])
    {
        int n = 4;

        System.out.println(multiplyBySeven(n));
    }
}
